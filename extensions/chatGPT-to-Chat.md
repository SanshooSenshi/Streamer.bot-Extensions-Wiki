description: Make Your Bot Answer Anything (by lebluxtv)

This Requires an OpenAI Key, which is a paid service{.is-warning}

# Import Code
```text

``` 

# Installation
Just Import the code above In Streamer.bot (top left import button) . Copy the Import Code and paste it into the Import String field .

# Configuration
This is limited to 100 tokens which should be more than adequate for most use cases

- set the API key 
- set the Context for the AI ( in my example I used " you are a poet doing response only with rhymes )
- set the expected Tokens Count to spend 
- set the first message for the response ( meanwhile the code is waiting for the response generated )

# Example Use
|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`!chatGPTturbo` | follow the command by the message to send to the A.I. |
